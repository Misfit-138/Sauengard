# Sauengard

> SAUENGARD is an old-school text adventure inspired by 8-bit
games from the 1970's and 1980's such as Infocom's Zork series
and Telengard by Daniel Lawrence. It also draws from fond
memories of Milton Bradley's Dark Tower, and my limited 
exposure to 'Advanced Dungeons and Dragons'.
It is a text-driven adventure RPG with a sophisticated leveling
system, battle mechanics and character creation/leveling. 

## Development:

- Development is ongoing. Currently built on/for Windows,
with sound. GNU/Linux should work, but without sound. Anyone
willing to help with a GNU/Linux sound port is welcome. It
should be quite simple.

## Installation:

- Prerequisites: Python v3
- Download the files to a folder and run with

C:\ py */path/to/main.py*

or

$ python */path/to/main.py*
