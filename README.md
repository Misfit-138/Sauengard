# Sauengard

> SAUENGARD is an old-school *text adventure* inspired by 8-bit
games from the 1970's and 1980's such as Infocom's Zork series,
Telengard by Daniel Lawrence, as well as Milton Bradley's 
brilliant Dark Tower table-top electronic board game. 
The core mechanics derive heavily from the ubiquitous 20-side
die system.
It is a fun and immersive RPG with relatively sophisticated 
battle system, great loot and inventory, customizable character
creation, and leveling.

## Development:

- Development is ongoing. Currently built on/for Windows,
with sound. GNU/Linux should work, but without sound. Anyone
willing to help with a GNU/Linux sound port is welcome. It
should be quite simple.

## Installation:

- Prerequisites: Python v3
- Download the files to a folder and run with
```
C:\ py /path/to/main.py
```
or
```
$ python3 /path/to/main.py
```
