'My time is past', said the old man, 'but your time begins NOW.'
Standing beside a partially scorched writing table in a once-great library which now lays in ruin and disarray, Gorndam,
the eldest living scholar of Tinbar looks up, over his spectacles at you with weariness and worry.
'Tinbar is no more. Those strong enough to fight have fought bravely and died. I dare say, it is merely blind chance
