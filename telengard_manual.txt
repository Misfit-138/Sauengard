4. Monsters

The monsters of Telengard are many and varied. All monsters, like the characters
who
trespass for their hides, have experience level ratings. Like a character's
rating,
the higher the number the more powerful it is. There are two very distinct types
of
monsters in Telengard: Undead and Living.

Undead monsters are vile creatures that have managed to live past their
appointed hour
of death due to some foul curse. They have no heartbeat, no breath; they do not
sleep
and cannot usually be charmed. You will no doubt find that they have not lost
their
appetite however! Undead monsters have a (U) after their name in the monster
listings.

Living monsters are normal creatures that eat, sleep, drink and dance upon dead
warriors'
bodies. Living monsters have a (L) after their name in the monster listings.

	1) Gnoll (L)
	   A sawed-off freak, not too tough but nasty nonetheless. Lowlife of the
dungeon.

	2) Kobold (L)
	   A close relative of the Gnoll, fond of pricking unwary adventurers with
their
	   cranial horn. Like a Gnoll they like to hamstring you and slit your throat

	3) Skeleton (U)
	   Your basic rampaging bag of bones. No brains but will attack relentlessly
until
	   vanquished.

	4) Hobbit (L)
	   Not the nice type you're used to, this nimble little creature is
definitely not
	   to be trusted. He'd sooner make off with a magical item than have a
confrontation.

	5) Zombie (U)
	   A newly-risen corpse, slightly cannier than a skeleton only because
it's not
	   completely rotted out.

	6) Orc (L)
	   Sly, foul-smelling and not too nice. Orcs have taken a liking to munching
on
	   unwary travellers.

	7) Fighter (L)
	   A competent mercenary out to make his fortune by dispatching you as quickly
as
	   possible and stealing your gold and valuables.

	8) Mummy (U)
	   A bandage-wrapped monster fresh from the crypt. More deadly than a zombie
due to
	   its more preserved state.

	9) Elf (L)
	   A nimble and cunning threat. Elves fight well when forced to and are skilled
at
	   thieving as well.

       10) Ghoul (U)
	   A creature with a rather tainted reputation for feasting upon corpses and
robbing
	   graves for meat. Beware - its touch can paralyze!

       11) Dwarf (L)
	   A brawny, tunnel-dwelling creature that feels right at home in TELENGARD.
Skilled
	   at using an axe to lop off heads; also known to pick pockets.

       12) Troll (L)
	   A nine-foot tall, loathsome man-eating brute you'd do best avoid
altogether.

       13) Wraith (U)
	   The undead spirit of a dead warrior out for revenge. Wraiths have been known
to take
	   away Experience Points, draining a character's level.

       14) Ogre (L)
	   A stocky, ill-tempered eight-foot hairy cousin of the giant. A vicious
opponent that
	   never gives mercy.

       15) Minotaur (L)
	   An ugly result of cross-breeding between an Ogre and a large bull. Their
breath alone
	   can kill small dogs and feeble adventurers.

       16) Giant (L)
	   A grotesquely overgrown humanoid. Fond of fighting with a club or small
tree. The
	   Giants of TELENGARD are no pushover.

       17) Specter (U)
	   Spirit of an ancient warrior king long dead. Like a Wraith, the Specter can
drain a
	   character's Experience Level. Beware!

       18) Vampire (U)
	   The most hideous and distasteful of the "Undead". It's touch
can paralyze and its bite
	   can drain a character's blood as well as his Level.

       19) Demon (L)
	   A foul beast summoned from the nether plains. Demons are armed with a deadly
whip and a
	   flaming sword. The sword's dangerous, but the whip's worse!

       20) Dragon (L)
	   King of the nasties. Dragons like to barbeque young warriors with a small
gust of their
	   disagreeable breath. A good beginner's tip is "Never fight a
Dragon!"

*****************************************************************************************************************

Choose a challenge rating (CR) for your trap, object, effect, or creature
between 1 and 30. Write down its statistics from the following formulas:
• AC = 12 + ½ CR (or choose between 10 and 20 based on the story)
• DC = 12 + ½ CR
• Hit Points = 20 × CR
• Attack Bonus = 3 + ½ CR
• Proficient Saves or Skills = 3 + ½ CR
• Single-Target Damage = 7 × CR (or 2d6 per CR)
• Multi-Target Damage = 3 x CR (or 1d6 per CR)

Difficulty Class:
Task Difficulty   DC
Very easy         5
Easy              10
Medium            15
Hard              20
Very hard         25
Nearly impossible 30

Deadly Encounter Benchmark
• Choose monster types and numbers that
make sense for the situation in the story.
• Compare total monster challenge ratings to
total character levels. An encounter may be
deadly if total CRs are greater than these
thresholds:

Level   Deadly Monster CR Threshold
1-4     CRs > ¼ Total Character Levels
5-10    CRs > ½ Total Character Levels
11-16   CRs > ¾ Total Character Levels
17-20   CRs > Total Character Levels

Monster Hordes
Attacks and Saves: Assume
one quarter of attacks or saves
succeed. Adjust up or down
based on circumstances.

Hit Points and Damage: Track
damage done to the horde.
Each time the horde takes
enough damage to kill an
individual monster, remove a
monster. Remove three
quarters of monsters targeted
with areas of effect.
*********************************************************************************************************************
BATTLING!
Target
Identify your target to the table.
Attack

Roll a d20. During an Attack roll, 1 always fails, and 20 always succeeds.
Modify
Add your modifiers.
proficiency + ability score modifier.
If you have any spells, class features, magic items or whatever that says it adds to your attack rolls, add those too.
Armor Class
If the modified result is ≥ target’s Armor Class (AC) , the attack hits the target.
Damage
Roll Damage Dice and add modifiers.
 Weapon Damage: the weapon's listed damage + ability score modifier.
 Same as above with regards to spells, class features, magic items, etc.
 If something says it adds to the damage with your weapon, add it to the damage.
 The target’s HP are reduced, factoring resistances and vulnerabilities.
 18 DEX is +4 modifier.
 If your proficiency is +2 (and assuming you are actually proficient with the weapon),
 and you roll a 10 that's: 10 + 2 + 4 = 16. For damage, a longbow is 1d8. You roll a 4, so: 4 + 4 = 8.
The formula for the Proficiency Bonus is
{2 + (Total Level-1)/4}Rounded Down or 1 + (total level/4)Rounded up, both formulas will give the same results.
Spell Attack
Many spells count as attacks.
The caster rolls d20 + Spellcasting Ability Modifier + Proficiency Bonus to hit vs AC. PHB 205
********************************************************************************************************************
ARMOR CLASS
Here are a few examples of Base AC calculations:

No Armour: Base AC = 10 + Dexterity modifier
Leather Armour: Base AC = 11 + Dexterity modifier
Chain Shirt: Base AC = 13 + Dexterity modifier (max +2)
Plate Mail: Base AC = 18
Mage Armour spell: Base AC = 13 + Dexterity modifier
Barbarian Unarmoured Defense
ability: Base AC = 10 + Dexterity modifier + Constitution modifier
Monk Unarmoured Defense ability: Base AC = 10 + Dexterity modifier + Wisdom modifier
Sorcerer Draconic Resilience ability: Base AC = 13 + Dexterity modifier
Meanwhile, there are several ways of further modifying your Armour Class. A few examples of these

Shield: +2 bonus to AC*
Shield of Faith spell: +2 bonus to AC
Shield spell: +5 bonus to AC
Half Cover: +2 bonus to AC
Three-Quarters Cover: +5 bonus to AC
+1 Armour: +1 bonus to AC
Ring of Protection: +1 bonus to AC; requires attunement
Bracers of Defense: +3 bonus to AC when not wearing armour or using a shield; requires attunement
Arrow Catching Shield: +1 bonus to AC against ranged attacks; requires attunement
There is at least one unusual exception to how AC is calculated:

Barkskin spell: Your minimum AC is 16.
