Standing over the defeated queen in glorious victory and catching your breath, you and your companions exchange silent
affirmations, which gradually grow into grins, chuckling, and finally, elated laughter!
"Unscathed! Pure, complete victory!", shouts Magnus, in partial disbelief.
"Indeed! Well done, my friends, well done!", adds Vozzbozz.
Tor'Bron raises a fist and howls with a powerful cry, "So it ends!"
"So it ends...", you mutter, as you drop your pack, and take a seat upon it. The three continue to congratulate each
other in a cacophony of laughs, shouts and banter.
Si'Kira notices your silence and approaches, wiping blood from her mouth and sheathing her dark blade.
"So gloomy, my friend! What vexes thee?", she queries in a tone of kindness.
"So much loss. So much pain. And, what has been gained by this?", you lament, and continue,
"What is lost is gone forever."
"True enough, true enough.", she agrees. After a pause, she adds, "We have stopped the hemorrhaging wound of
our world, and soon we will begin to heal."
Silently, you look up at her smooth features and optimistic smile, framed by her silvery locks.
Standing up and offering a hand, she says, "We have the rest of our lives to ponder."
Taking it in yours, you raise yourself up as she shouts, "Right now, there is some ale to drink!!"
The other three overhear her announcement and agree in a chorus of laughter.
"To the Slumbering Bear, then!", cries Lazarus, swooping in from the darkness, and then flying off just as abruptly.
